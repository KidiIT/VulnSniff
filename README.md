> user must have administrative privileges (e.g., 'sudo'access)

## installation Instructions:
1. **Clone the Repository**:```bash
 git clone https://github.com/KidiIT/VulnSniff.git

cd VulnSniff
3.  set up a virtual Environement(Optional but Recommended)
## For Linux/MacOS:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

## For Windows:

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

## For Linux:

sudo apt-get install nmap  
## For macOS

brew install nmap 

##  Usage
To start using VulnSniff, run the following command:
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py --interface eth0 --scan-target 192.168.1.1
## Command-lin Options:
.--interface: Specify the network interface to sniff packets.
.--scan-target:Provide the IP address or network range to scan for vulnerabilities
##  Example Workflow
1. Identify your network interface:
ifconfig
2.  Run VulnSniff on your chosen interface:
   sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py --interface eth0

##  License and Contribution Guidelines
VulnSniff project is an open-source and free to use under MIT License. Contributions are welcome. please fork the repository and submit pull request.

##  Troubleshooting
1.  if you get a "permission denied" error, try running the tool with `sudo`

3.  most importantly, this error "No module named scapy" you'll often experience this error.
   #  Solution 
   Run this code on your command-line to install the right scapy.all on your Ubuntu Linux machine:  `sudo apt-get install python3-scapy`
4.  lastly,please  I'll recommend you update your Ubuntu from wls1 to wls2. 
## Steps to update your ubuntu from wls1 to wls2 on Windows(Recommended if you're running wls1 on your Linux machine)
1. On your Windows, open the powershell terminal as an adminstrator
2. when done, like wls  after which you'll logged in as the root-user just like on your Linux operating system.
3. ## run this command: `wsl --set-version ubuntu 2 in Powershell.
this command sets the WSL version for your ubuntu distribution from the windows side. Make sure to run PowerShell as an administrator for the command to work.

##   Uninstallation instructions
1. Deactivate the virtual environemnt(if activated):

$ deactivate

Remove the cloned directory:
$ rm -rf VulnSniff

In conclusion, I'm so overwhelmed sharing this tremendous and proactive Tool with the Open Source community. I hope y'all wll enjoy and have the best vulneriability spart canning experience with my Tool. Thanks for being part of my career journey as a cybersecurity professionals and a security researcher.


#  New Release: [VulnSniff v1.1.0]- Real-Time alert & Enhanced Filtering! ðŸ¥‡
I'm excited to announce a major update to VulnSniff! this release introduces new features designed to enhance security monitoring and make it even easier to detect potential threats in real-time. Thank you to the open-Source community for your continued support and contributions.

## Key Features in v1.1.0

1. Real-Time Slack Alerts: VulnSniff now integrates seamlessly with Slack for real-time notifications. Any detected activity from specified IPs or ports is instantly sent to your designated Slack channel, ensuring your security team is always informed of suspicious network behavior.
2. Configurable IP and Port Filtering: Easily customize VulnSniff to filter specific IP addresses and ports through the config.yaml file. this allows precise monitoring of high-risk or specific IPs and ports, helping you focus on the traffic that matters most.
3. Improved Error Handling and Stability: The new version includes enhanced error handling for reliable performance, with informative error handling messages if Slack notification fail to send
4. Easy-to-Configure Webhook URL: We've simplified the Slack webhook configuration, letting you add or update it directly from the config.yaml file. This improvement makes setting up or modifying alert configurations straightforward.
